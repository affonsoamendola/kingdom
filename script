Farpoint Lookout.
-Titles fadeout-

The Blue Technocrat leader, Ultramarine, shares a conversation with his wife, Laurel

Ultramarine: You know where he is right now?

Laurel: Where?

Ultramarine: On an old bookstore, under the new city.

Laurel: You let him go?

Ultramarine: No.
Ultramarine: He just went anyway.

Ultramarine: Picklocked the door, and disabled the security cameras you put everywhere.
Ultramarine: They came back online immediatly after, so he still got caught on video.

Laurel: And why is he there?
Laurel: Did he evade the guards?

Ultramarine: No.
Ultramarine: I just conceded.

Ultramarine: I could lock him into his room and just made him stay there.
Ultramarine: But I decided against it.
Ultramarine: I sent Olive to watch over him.
Ultramarine: He'll be fine.

Laurel: He's stubborn.

Ultramarine: I'm stubborn.

Laurel laughs.

Laurel: He really is your son.

At this moment, a flash of light is seen on the moon, and it starts heading towards the planet.

Ultramarine: What is that?

Both are shocked.

Laurel: Its... I have no idea.

The light keeps its heading, looking like its going to fall right on the two watching.

Ultramarine: It's heading towards us, what in the Light is that!?

The light seems to collide with something in midair, causing a flash, it fragments in thousands of small pieces, and a larger piece, now heading west.

It enters the atmosphere, causing even more light, and hits the ground in the distance, causing yet another flash of light.

Ultramarine: What was that?!

Ultramarine takes a communicator from his robe, as he does a voice comes through

Communicator: Ultramarine! Sir! Do you copy?

Ultramarine: Yes, I just saw it, any info?

Communicator: Head to the observatory, the Technologists are assembling.

Ultramarine: On my way.

Ultramarine starts heading out, Laurel stays behind, looking out to the crash site

Ultramarine: Laurel?

Laurel: Ultra? What was that??

Ultramarine: I have no idea, lets go
