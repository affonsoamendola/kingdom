The Kingdom of the Spectra

Point and click adventure game, heavily inspired by Loom (LucasArts, 1990).

Game makes heavy use of colors, every character is a physical representation of the color he represents, a blue character is more thinking and somber than a red character, who is more emotive and passionate.

--------------
World Building
--------------

Billions of years ago a rogue star passed in-between the earth-moon system and the Sun, causing the earth-moon system to shoot out to deep space as such, Earth turned into a rogue planet, cooling down massively and basically destroying the human civilization, however, a few human settlements still existed, humanity couldn't thrive anymore, but they were prepared, they built a giant fusion reactor on the moon, and connected it to planet earth thru a series of humongously powered lasers, also they built a giant spotlight on the moon towards earth to maintain temperature in a certain area.

Humanity is now but a shadow of their former selves, they cant really be considered human anymore, they call themselves Colors now, and are intrinsically related to the eletromagnetic spectrum.

Three main kingdoms arose from the billions of years of conflict and chaos in the lit area, The Blue, The Red, and The Green, currently ruled by Ultramarine, Crimson and Emerald, they were unified into a single Empire by the White Emperor, a legendary figure that was himself born at least a million years ago.

The White Emperor is actually a lie, created by the RGB kings of the past, to instill a sense of order thru the power of legend, they maintain him through projections like a wizard of Oz kind of thing.

Narrative
--------------


Idea 1
---------------------
You play as the son of Ultramarine, heir apparent to the blue kingdom.

At some point Ultramarine kills Emerald and Crimson and takes over the whole of the RGB kingdoms under his rule.

The Player gets exiled to the lands of infrared, there he explores the darkness of outside of the spotlight and learns that the Old White King is alive.

The Player finds the old white king in a decrepit gray state, having lost his faith in Colorkind, He learns of the RGB kings treason that ended up almost killing the Now Gray King.

The Player must then find the other colors that lie dormant within himself through the friends that he made along the way, and he slowly turns into A New White King

At some point, The Player ends up on the moon station, learning why his father betrayed his old friends, the fusion reactor in the moon is running out of fuel, and without it, the Color civilization will collapse.

Having learned this, the player goes back to the Blue Citadel and confronts his father.

The player then has the choice of uniting with his father to try (and ultimaly fail) in saving Colorkind or avenging Crimson and Emerald and exiling or killing his own father, becoming the new White King in the process thus obtaining the power to try (and ultimaly fail) in saving Colorkind 
---------------------------

Idea 2.
---------------------------
You play as the illegitimate son of the ruler of Blue, Ultramarine and some random Red,

You are not Important to the story in the slightest. Your actions wont affect the story in the slightest, but you are an observer.




----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The closer you get to the center of the spotlight the brighter it gets, the closer you get to the white spire, the brighter it gets, basically the entire kingdom revolves around the idea that the white king is the source of all light an etc.

At some point find voyager.
