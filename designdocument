The Kingdom of the Spectra

Point and click adventure game, heavily inspired by Loom (LucasArts, 1990).

Game makes heavy use of colors, every character is a physical representation of the color he represents, a blue character is more thinking and somber than a red character, who is more emotive and passionate.

World Building

Billions of years ago a rogue star passed in-between the earth-moon system and the Sun, causing the earth-moon system to shoot out to deep space as such, Earth turned into a rogue planet, cooling down massively and basically destroying the human civilization, however, a few human settlements still existed, humanity couldn't thrive anymore, but they were prepared, they built a giant fusion reactor on the moon, and connected it to planet earth thru a series of humongously powered lasers, also they built a giant spotlight on the moon towards earth to maintain temperature in a certain area.

Humanity is now but a shadow of their former selves, they cant really be considered human anymore, they call themselves Colors now, and are intrinsically related to the eletromagnetic spectrum.

Three main kingdoms arose from the billions of years of conflict and chaos in the lit area, The Blue, The Red, and The Green, ruled by Ultramarine, Crimson and Emerald, they were unified into a single Empire by the White Emperor, a legendary figure that was himself born at least a million years ago.

The White Emperor is actually a lie, created by the RGB kings of the past, to instill a sense of order thru the power of legend, they maintain him through projections like a wizard of Oz kind of thing.
